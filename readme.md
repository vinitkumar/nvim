## NeoVim

![nvim-current](./nvim-current.png)

It is a minimal nvim config only based on a single file `init.lua` and colors directory containing some colorschemes that I like

It contains minimum amount of plugin:
- Fzf for navigation
- Coc for completion and integration with LSP
- Fugitive and Commentary for Git and Commenting

Here is the current setup, running rose-pine theme and using Iosevka font
It is meant to be stable and useful to write code and more code and not be overloaded.
